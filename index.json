Despite the advantages of logging, poor logging practices can potentially leak sensitive data. The problem of data leakage is more severe in applications that run on mobile devices, since these devices carry sensitive identification information ranging from physical device identifiers (e.g., IMEI MAC address) to communications network identifiers (e.g., SIM, IP, Bluetooth ID), and application-specific identifiers related to the location and the users’ accounts. This preliminary study explores the impact of logging practices on data leakage of such sensitive information. Particularly, we want to investigate whether log-related statements inserted into an application code could lead to data leakage. While studying logging practices in mobile applications is an active research area, to our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the interplay between logging and security in the context of mobile applications for Android. We propose an approach called MobiLogLeak, an approach that identifies log statements in deployed apps that leak sensitive data. MobiLogLeak relies on taint flow analysis. Among 5,000 Android apps that we studied, we found that 200 apps leak sensitive data through logging.","tags":["Android","Data-Leakage"],"title":"MobiLogLeak: A Preliminary Study on Data Leakage Caused by Poor Logging Practices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rui Zhou"],"categories":["Thesis","Study"],"content":" I would like to share my experience about my view of M.A.Sc and M.Eng in English, Chinese and French.
